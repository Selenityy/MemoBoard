# MemoBoard - A Full-Stack Task and Project Management Application

Welcome to the MemoBoard repository, a comprehensive task and project management platform inspired by popular tools like Asana and Trello. This project is a showcase of my full-stack development skills, demonstrating proficiency in creating dynamic web applications that cater to productivity and team collaboration.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
- **Dynamic Project Boards**: Users can create, manage, and delete project boards that reflect their workflow needs.
- **Task Managemen**t: Tasks (memos) can be added, updated, or deleted within projects with options for setting deadlines, descriptions and progress tracking.
- **Drag and Drop Interface**: Intuitive sorting and organization of tasks within projects using drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Changes made by users are updated in real-time across the platform, enhancing collaboration among team members.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a seamless user experience across various screen sizes.
- **Dark and Light Mode**: Users can toggle between dark and light themes for personalized comfort.
- **Demo Account**: A test account is provided for exploring the OdinBook features, no sign up required.

## Learning and Challenges

This project has been instrumental in refining my skills across several dimensions:

- **React and Redux Integration**: Mastering state management with Redux in a React-driven environment was crucial for handling complex state logic across the application.
  
- **Advanced Backend Logic**: Implementing complex server-side logic with Express and integrating it seamlessly with MongoDB for dynamic data storage and retrieval.

- **Responsive and Adaptive Design**: Ensuring the application's interface adapts smoothly across different devices challenged my CSS and design skills, especially when integrating Bootstrap and SCSS.

- **Security Implementation**: Learning to secure web applications using JWT for authentication and secure HTTP headers and responses was pivotal.

## Future Plans

As MemoBoard continues to evolve, here are some exciting updates and enhancements planned to further refine and expand its capabilities:

- **Advanced Task Management Features**: Integrate sorting, filtering, tagging, and a calendar view to boost productivity and organization.
- **UI Improvements**: Implement instant updates for section names and optimize memo rendering with a 'Save' button for batch updates, significantly reducing unnecessary data fetches.
- **Enhanced Notifications**: Upgrade alerts to interactive pop-up boxes, facilitating easier task management and memo migration.
- **Security and Accessibility**: Add features for Google OAuth, password changes and recovery via email, alongside comprehensive Cypress testing for robust integration and end-to-end coverage.
- **Flexible Section Placement and Subtask Visibility**: Allow sections to be added on both sides of the screen and display icons for tasks containing subtasks, improving navigation and task hierarchy visibility.
- **Feature Restoration**: Reinstate views for 'Today', 'This Week', and 'My Memos' to offer quick access to time-sensitive tasks.

These planned enhancements aim to make MemoBoard not only more versatile and user-friendly but also a more powerful tool for managing personal and professional projects.

## Final Note

MemoBoard marks a significant milestone in my journey as a full-stack developer. With each project, I aim to challenge myself by learning new libraries or frameworks. This project provided an opportunity to learn Bootstrap and Sass, enhancing my design and styling skills. It showcases my capability to conceptualize, design, and implement a robust and user-friendly web application. I invite you to explore the repository to delve into the codebase, understand the application's architecture, and explore the functionalities I've meticulously crafted throughout this project.
